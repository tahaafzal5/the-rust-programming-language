# Introduction

* Rust is designed to write fast AND safe code whose compiler works *with* you to help you.
* The Rust compiler catches errors that might occur with low-level development where you're managing your own memory.
* Every two or three years, the Rust team produces a new Rust edition. Each edition brings together the features that have landed into a clear package with fully updated documentation and tooling. Default edition is 2015 if not defined in the cargo.toml file.
* `cargo` is the included dependency manager and build tool that makes adding, compiling, and managing dependencies painless and consistent across the Rust ecosystem.
* `rust-analyzer` is Rust's language server and provides features like IntelliSense.
* `rustc` is the Rust compiler.
* `rustdoc` is the documentation tool.
* `rustfmt` is the formatting tool.
  * `rustfmt` allows finer-grained control and `cargo-fmt` understands conventions of a project that uses Cargo. 
* `rustup` is a command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools.
* Clippy is Rust's static analyzer.
* `cargo fix` automatically upgrades your code to a new edition.

### Installing Rust
* The version of curl that is installed by homebrew does not support the `-tls` option, so removing it from the default rust install command line fixed the error: "curl: (4) A requested feature, protocol or option was not found built-in in this libcurl due to a build-time decision." 

### Intro to Cargo
* TOML stands for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language.
* Packages of code are referred to as crates.
* We can create a project using `cargo new`.
* We can build a project using `cargo build`.
  * TO build it for release, we use `cargo build --release`.
* We can build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.
* We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`.
* Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.
